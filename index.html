    <h4>For almost two years now the creature known as "Mango" has stalked this world.</h4>
    <p>Long before fully understanding the nature of his character, Mango was regarded as a 
        "precious boy". His flaws overlooked, his faults ignored. These were truly the golden days
        of bird ownership. 
    </p>
    <p>But alas, one fateful day a month or two after meeting, the beasts patience had finally waned.
       With all his impressive might, he <strong>struck</strong>, latching onto his victims
       eye and sending a clear message.
    </p>
    <p><strong>I am the captain now.</strong></p>
